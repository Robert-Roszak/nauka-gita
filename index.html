      <h2>Tiesto</h2>
      <p>I was lost <br>And I'm still lost <br>
      But I feel so much better <br>
      You can travel the world <br>
      But you can't run away <br>
      From the person you are in your heart <br>
      You can be who you want to be <br>
      Make us believe in you <br>
      Keep all your light in the dark <br>
      If you're searching for truth <br>
      You must look in the mirror <br>
      And make sense of what you can't see <br>
      Just be <br>
      Just be <br>
      They say learning to love yourself <br>
      Is the first step <br>
      That you take what you want to be real <br>
      But flying on planes to exotic locations <br>
      Won't teach you how you really feel <br>
      Face up to the fact <br>
      That you are who you are <br>
      And nothing can change that belief <br>
      Just be <br>
      Just be <br>
      Cause now I know <br>
      It's not so far <br>
      To where I go <br>
      The hardest part <br>
      It's inside me <br>
      I need <br>
      To just be <br>
      To just be <br>
      Just be <br></p>
